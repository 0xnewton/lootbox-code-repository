# lootbox-code-repository

Social network with revenue sharing for crypto games. Lootbox enables esports organizations by faciliating the creation of NFTs for esports teams which can then be dispensed to fans to promote the esports tournament & their sponsors. If that team wins the competition, the NFT holders get a portion of the prize money! Furthermore, the esports organization can earn revenue from advertisers, whose ads are served on the NFT ticket & throughout the app.
